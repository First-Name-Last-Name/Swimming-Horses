# Swimming Horses
## Ride your horses THROUGH the river
Traveling with your horse can be a lot of fun - until you have to cross a river. 

With this mod you can simply stay on the horse and ride it through the water (or even lava!) without sinking or being thrown off. 
The swimming is implemented in a very vanilla-like way as to not add any unbalances to the game.

Simply get the mod from either GitHub or Modrinth to make traveling with your horse even more fun and stress-free!

## Horse Buff compatible!
You like using Horse Buff? Then give this mod a try as well! Swimming Horses is 100% compatible with Horse Buff and greatly improves Horse Buff's inbuilt swimming mechanism: 
- This mod's swimming animation is designed to be very smooth and pleasing to the eye. Glide through the water smoothly, without any tacky movements!
- At some point during your journey you might find yourself and your horse fully submerged in water. Maybe you jumped off a cliff or were dragged under by magma blocks. Without this mod you would automatically be thrown off the horse. If inside a bubble column you would even have to follow the horse down and save it! (Try it out, horses die to magma blocks if they are not pushed out of the bubble column) With Swimming Horses you get to stay on your horse, even when submerged - it will simply swim back up to the surface once it is able to do so.
- There may come a point where you want to ride your horse across lava. Which means you better come prepared! With a splash potion of fire resistance and a copy of this mod even a lake of lava stops being an obstacle in your horse riding adventures.
  
To use Swimming Horses with Horse Buff, simply disalbe Horse Buff's inbuilt swimming mechanism. 

**Happy trails!**
